A Chrome Extension to make the Search Filter Buttons more obvious on Google Search Results

I grew exceptionally tied of Google's new UI that robs the search filter buttons (images, videos, maps, et al.) of their colour, icons and prominence with related search suggestions. This simple extension hopes to address that by adding colour to what I feel are the five most important search filters:

- Images
- Videos
- Maps
- Shopping
- News
