A Chrome Extension to make the Search Filter Buttons more obvious on Google Search Results

I grew exceptionally tired of Google's new UI that robs the search filter buttons (images, videos, maps, et al.) of their colour, icons and prominence with related search suggestions. This simple extension hopes to address that by adding colour to what I feel are the five most important search filters:

- Images
- Videos
- Maps
- Shopping
- News

The extension does not alter anything else and is usable specfically on google.com for now. Due to its simple nature, I do not foreesee any major issues aside from [installing it as a third-party extension](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/).
